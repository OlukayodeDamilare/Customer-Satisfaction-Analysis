# Customer-Satisfaction-Analysis

# Executive Summary
Businesses often focus on aggregate customer satisfaction scores, but these averages hide critical insights about what drives loyalty or frustration. This project identifies the key drivers of satisfaction and uncovers which customer segments need attention, enabling targeted, actionable improvements.

## Project Overview
Customer satisfaction is more than a single score — it signals product health, usability, and long-term retention. The goal of this project is to move beyond averages and provide segment-based insights that support better decision-making.
