# Customer-Satisfaction-Analysis

## Project Overview
Customer satisfaction is more than a single score — it is a signal of product health, usability, and long-term retention.

This project analyzes customer satisfaction data to identify:
- What drives satisfaction
- Where customers are most dissatisfied
- Which customer segments should be prioritized for improvement

The goal is to move beyond averages and provide *actionable, segment-based insights*.
